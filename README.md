Task 1: What is happening in the program?

You create a dictionary.
A dictionary is like a mini phonebook, but instead of phone numbers, it stores marks.
Example:

"Alice" → 85

"Bob" → 78

The program asks the user to type a student’s name.
Whatever name the user enters, the program will search for it in the dictionary.

If the name is found, the program shows that student’s marks.
For example, if the user types Alice, it prints:
Alice's marks: 85

If the name is not found, the program shows a message:
Student not found.


Task 2: What is happening in the program?

You create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
This is just a normal list like:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

You take only the first five numbers from that list.
Using slicing ([:5]), you extract:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You reverse these five numbers.
By using slicing again ([::-1]), the list becomes:
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

You print everything.

The original list

The first five extracted numbers

The reversed version of those five numbers
